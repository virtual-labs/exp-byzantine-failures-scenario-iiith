      "question": "What is a distributed system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A single computer with multiple cores.",
        "b": "A collection of independent computers that appears as a single system.",
        "c": "A network of computers in the same room.",
        "d": "A system with a single point of failure."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While a multi-core computer has multiple processing units, it is not a distributed system.",
        "b": "Correct. This is the definition of a distributed system.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While they may be in the same room, the key is that they are independent computers working together.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Distributed systems are often designed to avoid single points of failure."

      "question": "Which of the following is the most severe type of failure in a distributed system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Crash failure",
        "b": "Omission failure",
        "c": "Timing failure",
        "d": "Byzantine failure"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A crash failure is relatively simple to handle.",
        "b": "Incorrect. An omission failure is when a component fails to send or receive messages.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A timing failure is when a component's response is outside the expected time.",
        "d": "Correct. A Byzantine failure is the most severe because the component can behave arbitrarily and maliciously."

    {
      "question": "What is the main goal of the Byzantine Generals' Problem?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To win a battle.",
        "b": "To achieve consensus among generals, some of whom may be traitors.",
        "c": "To find the fastest communication path.",
        "d": "To elect a single leader general."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While the story is about a battle, the underlying problem is about consensus.",
        "b": "Correct. The problem illustrates the challenge of reaching agreement in the presence of malicious actors.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The problem is not about optimizing communication speed.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While a leader might be part of a solution, the core problem is about consensus."

    {
      "question": "In the context of the Byzantine Generals' Problem, if there are 'n' generals and 't' traitors, what is the condition to guarantee a solution?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "n > t",
        "b": "n > 2t",
        "c": "n > 3t",
        "d": "n = 2t + 1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is not sufficient to handle Byzantine failures.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is also not sufficient.",
        "c": "Correct. A solution is guaranteed only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While related to the number of messages, this is not the condition for solvability."

    {
      "question": "What is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A system that is tolerant to all types of faults.",
        "b": "A property of a system that allows it to tolerate Byzantine failures.",
        "c": "A type of hardware that prevents Byzantine failures.",
        "d": "A system that can only tolerate crash failures."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. BFT specifically refers to Byzantine failures.",
        "b": "Correct. BFT enables a system to continue operating correctly even with malicious components.",
        "c": "Incorrect. BFT is a property of the system's design and algorithms, not specific hardware.",
        "d": "Incorrect. BFT is designed for the most severe type of failure, not just crash failures."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a well-known BFT algorithm?",

        "b": "Paxos",
        "c": "Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)",
        "d": "Raft"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. TCP/IP is a communication protocol suite.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Paxos is a consensus algorithm, but it does not handle Byzantine failures.",
        "c": "Correct. PBFT is a landmark algorithm for achieving BFT.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Raft is a consensus algorithm, but it assumes non-malicious failures."

    {
      "question": "In PBFT, how many identical replies must a client receive to accept a result, if there are 't' faulty nodes?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "t",
        "b": "t + 1",
        "c": "2t",
        "d": "2t + 1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is not enough to ensure the result is valid.",
        "b": "Correct. The client needs to receive t+1 identical replies to be sure the result is correct, as at most 't' of them could be from faulty nodes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is the number of prepare messages a node needs to receive.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is the number of commit messages a node needs to receive."

    {
      "question": "Why are Byzantine failures a major concern in blockchain technology?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because blockchains are slow.",
        "b": "Because some participants (miners/validators) may be malicious and try to cheat the system.",
        "c": "Because blockchains use a lot of electricity.",
        "d": "Because blockchains are centralized."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Performance is a concern, but not directly related to Byzantine failures.",
        "b": "Correct. The decentralized and trustless nature of blockchains requires them to be resilient against malicious actors who might try to double-spend or censor transactions.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Energy consumption is an issue for some blockchains, but not the reason BFT is needed.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Blockchains are typically decentralized, which is why they need BFT."

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "advanced"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens in a BFT system if the number of faulty nodes 't' is such that n <= 3t?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The system works faster.",
        "b": "The system can no longer guarantee that it will reach a correct consensus.",
        "c": "The system automatically adds more nodes.",
        "d": "The system switches to a different algorithm."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The system's performance is not the primary issue.",
        "b": "Correct. If the number of faulty nodes is too high, the loyal nodes cannot be sure to outvote the malicious ones, and consensus cannot be guaranteed.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The system does not automatically scale in this way.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The system will fail to reach consensus using its current BFT algorithm."
